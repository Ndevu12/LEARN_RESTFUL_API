# SERVER, RESTFUL API  AND ENDPOINTS 

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of APIs and endpoints by exploring their functionalities and implementations. It also serves as a practical resource for testing APIs using `Postman`, a powerful GUI tool.

### PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY

The primary objective of this repository is to facilitate learning and understanding of APIs and endpoints. By documenting my journey of exploring these concepts and successfully implementing them, I aim to save others the time and effort I spent in searching for resources.
